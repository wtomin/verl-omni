# VeRL-Omni v0.2.0: Faster Diffusion RL and Stable Omni Training

> Estimated reading time: 10 minutes.
> Focus areas: faster diffusion RL and stable omni training.

VeRL-Omni `v0.2.0` establishes a stronger foundation for production-grade omni-modal reinforcement learning. This release improves the training stack across rollout performance, model integration, reward support, hardware coverage, and documentation, with two changes carrying the most impact:

- Faster diffusion RL, centered on higher-throughput Qwen-Image FlowGRPO rollout and V1 trainer support.
- Stable omni training, built around the omni V1 trainer, reusable model adapters, FSDP2, and vLLM-Omni rollout.

## 1. Faster Diffusion RL

Diffusion RL is expensive, but not in the same way as autoregressive language-model RL. A single rollout carries many denoising steps, large latent tensors, prompt embeddings, optional classifier-free guidance, reward-model scoring, old-log-prob recomputation, and policy-weight synchronization. For Qwen-Image FlowGRPO, there is no single villain in the profile. Step time is shaped by rollout generation, old-log-prob computation, reward scoring, actor update, and LoRA weight sync together.

### Key Features

The faster diffusion RL work has two main features.

- Request-level batching leads the rollout side. For supported diffusion adapters, it becomes the default batching path. Instead of sending diffusion generations through a serial loop, the engine now acts more like a traffic controller, with explicit concurrency knobs for scheduling rollout work.

- The trainer path matters just as much. Diffusion now has a V1 trainer path, bringing diffusion RL closer to the modern trainer architecture used elsewhere in VeRL-Omni and laying the groundwork for decoupled rollout and training execution.

Faster rollout only matters if the generated trajectories and log-probs still describe the same policy. This release fixes several correctness-sensitive areas: request-batched diffusion log-probs, async rollout semantics, rollout correction, and rank-local LoRA weight-update routes. Rollout correction also pays back in step time: bypass mode can skip actor old-log-prob recomputation. 

### Newly Support

The [rollout batching guide](https://verl-omni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/rollout_batching.html) explains both diffusion batching modes, how to enable them, and when to choose each mode. Current faster diffusion RL support is organized around these recipes:

### Recipe and Benchmark

The Qwen-Image LoRA OCR recipe is a good place to see the change. In the v0.1 line, rollout was the core bottleneck: each request effectively ran as serial `B≈1` DiT forwards, with 10 denoising steps and True-CFG doubling each step into two forwards. GPU utilization hovered around `80%`, not because the model was small, but because the engine could not keep enough diffusion work packed together.

In `v0.2.0`, request-level packing changes that shape. Multiple complete requests are packed into one transformer forward, GPU utilization rises to about `100%`, and isolated generation time drops from `226s` to `108s`, a `52%` reduction. The same story shows up in per-image generation latency, which falls with the packed rollout path. Reference runs: [Qwen-Image OCR LoRA v0.1 (r)](https://wandb.ai/mikecheung/flow_grpo/runs/o7x44yrr) and [Qwen-Image OCR LoRA v0.2](https://wandb.ai/mikecheung/flow_grpo/runs/1vsrnhbd).

In the charts below, the blue curve is `v0.1` and the green curve is `v0.2`.

</div>

The production-style Qwen-Image FlowGRPO recipes enable request-level batching by default. The main entry points are `run_qwen_image_ocr_lora.sh` for the baseline OCR reward setup, `run_qwen_image_ocr_lora_async_reward.sh` for async reward on a dedicated resource pool, and `run_qwen_image_ocr_lora_rollout_corr.sh` for rollout-correction bypass mode. The request-level rollout knobs are intentionally small and explicit:

```bash
actor_rollout_ref.rollout.step_execution=false
++actor_rollout_ref.rollout.engine_kwargs.vllm_omni.max_num_seqs=32
```

For Qwen-Image LoRA with True-CFG at 512 px, a practical tuning range is `max_num_seqs=8` to `32`; larger values can run into HBM pressure. SD3.5 has a lighter request-level memory shape and can use `max_num_seqs=256`.

After rollout generation is packed, old-log-prob recomputation becomes the next obvious target. On the 4-GPU Qwen-Image LoRA OCR recipe, recomputing old log-probs on stored SDE latents is about `20%` of a `420s` step, roughly `80s`. Rollout-correction bypass mode skips that actor-side pass and reuses rollout log-probs as `old_log_probs`; it should be paired with rejection sampling because vLLM and PyTorch attention can still leave a small off-policy gap.

To turn it on, use the rollout-correction recipe or pass the same overrides yourself:

```bash
algorithm.rollout_correction.bypass_mode=True
algorithm.rollout_correction.rollout_is=sequence
algorithm.rollout_correction.rollout_rs=seq_mean_k1
actor_rollout_ref.rollout.calculate_log_probs=True
```

The ready-to-run entry point is [`run_qwen_image_ocr_lora_rollout_corr.sh`](https://github.com/verl-project/verl-omni/blob/main/examples/flowgrpo_trainer/qwen_image/run_qwen_image_ocr_lora_rollout_corr.sh). `calculate_log_probs=True` is the key switch that makes rollout return the log-probs needed by bypass mode.

The recipe-level step-time numbers line up with that story: the baseline Qwen-Image FlowGRPO LoRA run is about `420s` per step on 4 × H800, while the async reward variant reaches about `360s` per step on 5 GPUs. Rollout-correction bypass removes another large chunk by skipping old-log-prob recomputation.

SD3.5 FlowGRPO shows the trainer side of the same release. The repository includes `run_sd35_medium_ocr_lora_v1.sh` for the V1 trainer in sync mode and `run_sd35_medium_ocr_lora_v1_separate_async.sh` for V1 `separate_async` rollout. In the current benchmark, v0 and v1 are roughly tied on step time, but the V1 run has a cleaner stability story as reward rises through training. Reference runs: [SD3.5 Medium OCR LoRA v0 trainer](https://wandb.ai/mikecheung/flow_grpo/runs/9ylk6e5f) and [SD3.5 Medium OCR LoRA v1 trainer](https://wandb.ai/mikecheung/flow_grpo/runs/h04p15jr).

## 2. Stable Omni Training

The other half of the release is stable omni training. Omni models are not just bigger language models; they are small systems with processors, modality-specific towers, trainable stages, and rollout-time behavior that has to stay aligned with the actor. `v0.2.0` moves the project from model-specific integrations toward a reusable omni training stack, so multimodal autoregressive training fits more naturally into VeRL-Omni's trainer, adapter, rollout, and recipe structure.

### Key Features

Here, the release pulls on two levers.

One lever is the `verl` V1 trainer architecture. Omni recipes get clearer worker orchestration, standard configuration overrides, and better alignment with vLLM-Omni rollout.

The other is the reusable omni model adapter layer. Instead of wiring each architecture as a one-off path, the trainer can rely on a shared interface for model setup, processor setup, trainable-stage selection, FSDP preparation, and rollout alignment.

### Newly Support

The current Qwen3-Omni adapter supports thinker-only training by redirecting training to the target component, stripping unused modules such as Talker and codec-related components, and working with FSDP/FSDP2 wrapping. Current stable omni training support is organized around these recipes:

| Model | Training mode | Algorithm / data | Script | Support | W&B run |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-Omni Thinker | text -> text | GSPO on GSM8K | [`run_qwen3_omni_thinker_gspo_lora_v1.sh`](https://github.com/verl-project/verl-omni/blob/main/examples/gspo_trainer/qwen3_omni/run_qwen3_omni_thinker_gspo_lora_v1.sh) | V1 trainer, reusable omni adapter, FSDP2, vLLM-Omni rollout | [gsm8k](https://wandb.ai/mikecheung/gspo/runs/j5mro1tn) |

A full omni post training support table in VeRL-Omni is available at [README.md](https://github.com/verl-project/verl-omni#model-and-algorithm-support-).

### Recipe and Benchmark

The best single recipe to highlight is **MMK12**. It exercises the new stable Qwen3-Omni path with real multimodal input: image plus text prompt, text answer, GSPO optimization, FSDP actor training, and vLLM-Omni rollout.

**MMK12 anchor recipe.** `run_qwen3_omni_thinker_gspo_lora_mmk12_v1.sh` trains Qwen3-Omni on K12 visual math reasoning (`image -> text`) with GSPO, LoRA rank 32, and colocated actor-rollout workers on 4 × H800 80GB. The rollout shape is 128 prompts × 16 responses, or 2048 samples per rollout. After training, the run reaches `0.833` validation reward, `0.998` actor-rollout Pearson correlation, and about `59 GB` GPU memory usage. See some training results in the reference run: [`MMK12 (wandb)`](https://wandb.ai/mikecheung/gspo/runs/2j8hxr36).

</div>

The MMK12 data pipeline converts raw MMK12 parquet shards into the verl RL parquet layout. Each row carries the image bytes inline and uses a prompt format that asks the model to produce a structured answer. The reward combines `math_verify` accuracy with a progressive format reward on the `<answer>...\boxed{}...</answer>` template.

To run the recipe:

```bash
python examples/gspo_trainer/data_process/mmk12.py \
    --local_dataset_path /path/to/mmk12/ \
    --local_save_dir ~/data/mmk12

TRAIN_FILE=$HOME/data/mmk12/train.parquet \
VAL_FILE=$HOME/data/mmk12/test.parquet \
bash examples/gspo_trainer/qwen3_omni/run_qwen3_omni_thinker_gspo_lora_mmk12_v1.sh
```

This anchors the `v0.2.0` stability story: Qwen3-Omni training is no longer just a model-specific launch path. It is a V1 trainer recipe with a reusable omni adapter, multimodal data handling, actor-rollout consistency metrics, and a documented image-to-text benchmark.

## Briefly: Other Updates

The release also expands the broader VeRL-Omni model and algorithm surface:

| Model / family | Category | Modality | Algorithm / recipe | Update |

| [BAGEL](https://github.com/verl-project/verl-omni/blob/main/examples/flowgrpo_trainer/bagel/README.md) | Unified understand + generation model | Text + Image | FlowGRPO | Adds full-parameter and LoRA recipes with OCR and PickScore rewards. |
| [SD3.5 + DiNa-LRM](https://verl-omni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/flowgrpo_trainer_sd35_drm.html) | Diffusion generator | Text -> Image | FlowGRPO with latent reward model | Scores clean diffusion latents directly, avoiding VAE decode during reward scoring. |
| [Flow-DPPO](https://verl-omni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algo/flowdppo.html) | Diffusion generator algorithm | Text/Image -> Image | Flow-DPPO | Adds an alternative policy-optimization recipe for Qwen-Image style diffusion RL. |
| [Wan2.2](https://github.com/verl-project/verl-omni/blob/main/examples/dancegrpo_trainer/README.md) | Diffusion video generator | Text -> Video | DanceGRPO | Adds video-generation RL recipe coverage. |

Outside the model-algorithm matrix, `v0.2.0` also adds Ascend NPU Dockerfiles and install guidance.

## Looking Ahead

The road after `v0.2.0` is fairly clear.

For diffusion RL, the next step is to keep moving from "works end-to-end" to "measurably efficient and diagnosable". The repository now has the features for this: batching modes, profiling recipes, and rollout-correction paths. Future benchmark suites should separate rollout, log-prob computation, reward scoring, weight sync, and actor update costs.

For omni model training, the adapter design should become a reusable model-integration pattern. It points toward more omni models with stage-specific training, for example, minicpm-o.

Correctness signals should keep getting tighter. For both diffusion and omni training, high throughput is only useful when log-probs, rollout trajectories, actor weights, and reward signals remain aligned. Metrics such as actor-rollout Pearson correlation, log-prob consistency, precision dumps, and step-level timing should become standard parts of every serious recipe.

Reproducibility should also become a first-class release goal. Future recipes should make it easier to rerun the same setup with pinned model versions, fixed data preprocessing, explicit seeds, stable configuration overrides, and published reference metrics. For long-running RL jobs, reproducibility is not only about getting the same final score; it is about making reward curves, timing breakdowns, memory usage, and validation outputs comparable across machines and releases.
